# 0.27.0

Breaking Changes:

* Remove deprecated `live_cell_widgets` library

New features:

* `.exception()` method for creating a cell that throws the exception held in its value:

  ```dart
  final e = MutableCell(Exception('An exception!'));
  final exceptionCell = e.exception();
  
  // Throws Exception('An exception!')
  e();
  ```

* Mutable variants of `.contains()` and `.containsAll()` extension methods

  `.contains()` and `.containsAll()` now return mutable cells when called on
  mutable cells containing sets.

  When the value of the `contains(...)` cell is set to true the item is added to the set, and
  when set to false the item is removed from the set:

  ```dart
  final set = MutableCell({1, 2, 3, 4});
  
  // contains1 is now a MutableCell
  final contains1 = set.contains(1.cell);
  
  // Setting its value to false removes 1 from [set].
  contains1.value = false;
  
  print(contains1.value); // Prints 2, 3, 4
  
  // Setting its value to true adds the element to the [set].
  contains1.value = true;
  
  print(contains1.value); // Prints 1, 2, 3, 4
  ```

  Similarly when the value of the `.containsAll` cell is set, the items in the iterable passed to
  it are added/removed from the set.

* `.removeAt()` method on cells holding lists:

  ```dart
  final l = MutableCell([1, 2, 3, 4]);
  
  // Remove the element at index 2
  l.removeAt(2);
  
  print(l.value); // Prints 1, 2, 4
  
  l.removeAt(0);
  print(l.value); // 2, 4 
  ```

* `UniqueCellKey`, which can be used as a cell key to specify that a cell is not functionally
  equivalent to any other cell.

  This is useful to prevent a cell from being assigned a key contexts, such as within the build
  method of a `CellWidget`, where a key is automatically assigned to a cell if it isn't explicitly
  provided during the construction of the cell.

# 0.26.0

New features:

* New `format` argument on `mutableString()` extension methods.

  Example:

  ```dart
  final germanFormat = NumberFormat("#,##0.00", "de_DE");
  
  final a = MutableCell(1.0);
  final strA = a.mutableString(format: germanFormat);
  
  a.value = 2.5;
  print(strA.value); // 2,50
  
  strA.value = '12,30';
  print(a.value); // 12.3
  ```

# 0.25.4

New features:

* `coalesce` extension method on `MutableCell`s.

  When `coalesce` is called on a `MutableCell`, a `MutableCell` is now returned. This allows
  assigning the value of the cell on which the method is called via the cell returned by `coalesce`.

  Example:

  ```dart
  final a = MutableCell<int?>(null);
  final b = MutableCell(-1);
  
  // c is a MutableCell
  final c = a.coalesce(b);
  
  ValueCell.watch(() {
    print('A = ${a()}');
  });
  
  ValueCell.watch(() {
    print('C = ${c()}');
  });
  
  b.value = 1; // Prints 'A = 1' and 'C = 1'
  
  // Assigning value of 'c' assigns value of 'a'
  c.value = 2; // Prints 'A = 2' and 'C = 2'
  
  // Doesn't print anything since the value of 'a' is not null
  b.value = 3;
  ```

# 0.25.3

* Fix issue with cell state restoration in widgets.

# 0.25.2

Update examples in readme.

# 0.25.1

Add missing Changelog entry for 0.25.0.

# 0.25.0

Breaking changes:

* The minimum Flutter version has been increased to 3.24.3.
* The `live_cells_widgets` library is deprecated. Use the `live_cells_ui` library.
* The `live_cells_ui` library provides the same functionality as `live_cells_widgets`
  with the following differences:

  * The widgets are prefixed with `Live` instead of `Cell`, e.g. `LiveTextField` from `live_cells_ui`
    is the equivalent to `CellTextField` from `live_cell_widgets`

  * Only those properties which represent user input are cells, the rest are regular values. For example
    in `LiveSwitch` only the `value` and `enabled` properties are cells.

  * `live_cells_ui` does not provide wrappers for widgets which do not take input from the user,
    for example there is no `LiveText` equivalent to `CellText`. Wrap a regular `Text` widget in a
    `CellWidget.builder` or a `CellWidget` subclass for reactivity.

# 0.24.1

New features:

* `reset` parameter in `MutableCell` constructor.

  This allows the value of a shared state mutable cell to be reset to the initial value
  when a new cell is created.

  Example:

  ```dart
  final myKey = MyKey();
  
  final a = MutableCell(1, key: myKey);
  
  ValueCell.watch(() {
    print(a.value);
  }); // Prints 1
  
  // Create a new shared state cell and reset the value of all
  // cells with key 'myKey' to 2
  
  final b = MutableCell(2, 
    key: myKey,
    reset: true
  );
  print(a.value); // Prints 2
  print(b.value); // Prints 2
  ```

## 0.24.0

New features:

* `.transform<...>()` for casting a cell's value type

  Example:

  ```
  ValueCell<Base> base = ...;
  final derived = base.transform<Derived>();
  ```

Bug fixes:

* Fix edge case bug in `mutableApply`.

Other changes:

* Update widget wrappers to Flutter 3.24.3

## 0.23.6

* Fix issue with return type of `MutableCell.notNull` extension method

## 0.23.5

New features:

* `.notNull` extension method on `MutableCell`

## 0.23.4

* Fix issue with mutable computed cell dependency tracking.

## 0.23.3

* Update homepage URL

## 0.23.2

Debugging Improvements:

* Exceptions held in a `Maybe` are now rethrown with the stack trace of the exception, when the
  `Maybe` is unwrapped with `Maybe.unwrap`.

## 0.23.1

New widgets:

* `CellCheckboxMenuButton`
* `CellCheckboxTheme`
* `CellChipTheme`
* `CellColoredBox`
* `CellColoredFilter`
* `CellCheckedPopupMenuItem`
* `CellChoiceChip`
* `CellCloseButton`
* `CellContraintsTransformBox`


## 0.23.0

New features:

* Watch function keys.

  Watch functions can now be identified by keys, like cells, provided in the `ValueCell.watch` and
  `Watch` constructor.

  ```dart
  final w1 = ValueCell.watch(() { ... }, key: 'key1');
  final w2 = ValueCell.watch(() { ... }, key: 'key2');
  
  w1 == w2; // true
  
  // Stops both w1 and w2 since they have the same keys
  w1.stop();
  ```

* Watch functions can now be defined directly in the build method of a `CellWidget` without
  `CellHooks`:

  ```dart
  CellWidget.builder((_) {
    final cell = MutableCell(...);
  
    ValueCell.watch(() {
      final c = cell();
      ...
    })
    ...
  });
  ```

Breaking Changes:

* `ValueCell.observe` no longer returns the value of the cell. Additionally, this eliminates the need
  to catch exceptions originating from the cell when the caller is only interested in being notified 
  when the value of the cell changes, but is not interested in the actual value. 

## 0.22.1

New widgets:

* `CellPageView`

  A `PageView` with the current page controlled by a `page` cell:

  ```dart
  final page = MutableCell(0);
  
  return CellPageView(
    page: page,
    animate: true.cell
    duration: Duration(milliseconds: 100).cell,
    curves: Curves.easeIn.cell
    
    children: [
       Page1(),
       Page2(),
       ...
    ].cell
  );
  ```

  The current page can be changed by setting the `page` cell.

  ```dart
  page.value = 2;
  ```

  The current page can also be observed by observing the same `page` cell.

## 0.22.0

New Features:

* `Watch`

  Registers a watch function that has access to its own handle.

  This can be used to 1) stop a watch function directly from within the watch function and 2)
  prevent code from running on the first call of the watch function.

  ```dart
  final watch = Watch((state) {
    final value = a();
    
    state.afterInit();
  
    // The following is only run after the first call
    print('A = $value');
    
    if (value > 10) {
      state.stop();
    }
  });
  ```

## 0.21.1

* Fix bug in `AsyncState` comparison.

## 0.21.0

New features:

* `.asyncState` for creating a cell that evaluates to the state of a cell holding a `Future`.

  `.asyncState` evaluates to an `AsyncState` which is a sealed union of:

  * `AsyncStateLoading`
  * `AsyncStateData`
  * `AsyncStateError`

Changes:

* Convert `Maybe` to a sealed union of:

  * `MaybeValue`
  * `MaybeError`

  This change does not break existing code.

## 0.20.4

* Fixed bug with deferred cell initialization not happening in `MetaCell`:

  Sometimes a cell was not initialized when it is injected in a `MetaCell`. This update ensures, that
  every every cell injected in a `MetaCell` is properly initialized.

## 0.20.3

* Fixed bug in `.coalesce()`: If coalesce value cell throws an exception it is
  propagated regardless of whether the cell, on which the method is called, is null or not.

## 0.20.2

* Improvements to cell updating algorithm.
* Fixed bug in `awaited` cells.

## 0.20.1

New features:

* `MutableMetaCell` and `ActionMetaCell`, which allow `MutableCell`s to have their values set,
  and `ActionCell`s to be triggered from `MetaCell`s.

Minor changes:

* The `.chain(...)` method can now be called on `ValueCell<void>`. Previously it could only be
  called on an `ActionCell`.

## 0.20.0

New features:

* `SelfCell`

  A computed cell which can access it's own value via the `self` argument:

  ```dart
  final increment = ActionCell();
  final cell = SelfCell((self) {
    increment.observe();
    return self() + 1;
  });
  ```

* Action cell chaining with `.chain(...)`

  `.chain(...)` creates an action cell that calls a user provided function when triggered. This
  function can decide whether to trigger the chained action or not.

* Null checking utilities:

  * `.notNull`

    Returns a cell with a value guaranteed to be non-null. If the value of the cell, on which the
    property is used, is `null`, a `NullCellError` exception is thrown.

  * `.coalesce(...)`

    Returns a cell that replaces null values in the cell, on which the method is used, with the value
    of another cell.

New widgets:

* `CellBanner`
* `CellBlockSemantics`
* `CellVisibility`

## 0.19.0

New features:

* Effect Cells

  These can be created with `.effect()` on an action cell (`ValueCell<void>`). An effect cell
  is guaranteed to only be run once per trigger of the action cell on which the `.effect()` method
  is called. This is useful for running side effects, while still being able to observe the result
  of the effect as a cell.

  Example:

  ```dart
  final result = action.effect(() async {
  return await submitForm();
  });
  ```

* Combining Action Cells:

  Multiple action cells can now be combined into a single cell, which notifies its observers, whenever
  any of the actions trigger, using `List.combined`

  Example:

  ```dart
  final a1 = ActionCell();
  final a2 = ActionCell();
  
  final all = [a1, a2].combined;
  ```

Breaking Changes:

* Async cells created with `.wait`, `.waitLast`, `.awaited` now throw an `PendingAsyncValueError`
  instead of `UninitializedCellError` when the cell value is referenced while the future is pending.

  This does not affect code which uses `.initialValue` to handle these errors.

* Renamed `onPressed` and `onLongPress` of cell Material buttons to `press` and `longPress`,
  respectively.

  The purpose of this change, is to later allow callback based event handlers to be added using
  `onPressed` and `onLongPress`

Other Changes:

* Computed cells no longer run the computation function on initialization. Instead the first run
  of the computation function is deferred to the first time the cell value is referenced.

  NOTE: This changes slightly the semantics of computed cells, especially dynamic computed cells
  which are now dormant until their value is referenced at least once.

* Clarify semantics of `ValueCell.none`:

  If a `null` default value is given and `ValueCell.none` is used during the computation of the
  initial value of a cell, `UninitializedCellError` is thrown.

* Bug fix: Unhandled exceptions in a `ValueCell.watch` no longer propagate out of the watch function.


## 0.18.4

* Improve action cell example.

## 0.18.3

* Add example of action cells to example project.

## 0.18.2

* Allow setting cell values in watch functions.

## 0.18.1

Additions from core:

* Add `.whenReady` property on `MetaCell`s.

  This property creates a cell that evaluates to `ValueCell.none` while the meta cell is empty.

* Add `MetaCell.inject` method as an alias for `MetaCell.setCell`.
* Allow watch functions to be terminated using `ValueCell.none()` like compute functions.

## 0.18.0

New features from core:

* Meta Cells

  A meta cell (`MetaCell`) is a cell that points to another cell. The value of a meta cell is the
  value of the pointed to cell, and its observers are notified when the pointed to cell's value
  changes.

  The pointed to cell can be changed multiple times.

  Example:

  ```dart
  final a = MutableCell(0);
  final b = MutableCell(1);
  
  final meta = MetaCell<int>();
  
  meta.setCell(a);
  print(meta.value); // 0
  
  meta.setCell(b);
  print(meta.value); // 1
  ```

* A `.hold()` method for keeping a cell active until it is released with `.release()`

  ```dart
  final a = MutableCell(0, key: aKey);
  
  // Ensure that a is active
  final hold = a.hold();
  ...
  // Allow a to be disposed
  hold.release();
  ```

New widgets:

* `CellElevatedButton`
* `CellFilledButton`
* `CellOutlinedButton`
* `CellTextButton`

Breaking Changes:

* Removed `dispose()` method from `MutableCell` interface.
* Reading/writing the value of a keyed `MutableCell` while it is inactive now throws an
  `InactivePersistentStatefulCellError`.

  Use `.hold()` to ensure a keyed `MutableCell` is active before using it.

## 0.17.0

New features:

* Automatic key generation for unkeyed cells defined in the `build` method of `CellWidget` and
  `CellWidget.builder`.

  This allows cells local to a `CellWidget` to be defined directly in the build method/function
  without having to use `.cell(() => ...)`

  With version 0.4.0:

  ```dart
  class Example extends CellWidget with CellInitializer {
    @override
    Widget build(BuildContext context) {
      final count = cell(() => MutableCell(0));
      ...
    }
  }
  ```

  This can now be simplified to the following with version 0.5.0:

  ```dart
  class Example extends CellWidget {
    @override
    Widget build(BuildContext context) {
      final count = MutableCell(0);
      ...
    }
  }
  ```

**Breaking Changes**:

* `CellInitializer` has been renamed to `CellHooks`
*
* `.cell()` and `.watch()` have been moved from `BuildContext` to `CellHookContext`.

  This will not affect code that uses `CellWidget.builder`.

* State restoration options have been removed from `.cell()`. Use `.restore()` instead.

## 0.16.2

Changes from core:

* Add exception handling to initial cell watch function calls.
* Improve unhandled exception notices.

## 0.16.1

* Fix typos in Changelog.

## 0.16.0

* The following methods for waiting for changes in cell values:
  * `.nextChange()`
  * `.untilValue()`
  * `.untilTrue()`
  * `.untilFalse()`

* `ActionCell`

  A cell without a value, used solely to represent actions and events.

New widgets:

* `CellAbsorbPointer`
* `CellAnimatedCrossFade`
* `CellAnimatedFractionallySizedBox`
* `CellAnimatedPositionedDirectional`
* `CellAnimatedRotation`
* `CellAnimatedScale`
* `CellAnimatedSlide`
* `CellAnimatedSwitcher`
* `CellAnnotatedRegion`

Other changes:

* Removed deprecated `computeCell` and `computeWidget` extension methods on `List`
* Removed deprecated `RestorableCellWidget`

## 0.15.1

* Fix issue with `.isCompleted` having incorrect value when `Future` completes with an error.

## 0.15.0

New features from core:

* `.awaited` property on cells holding a `Future`.

  Returns a cell which evaluates to the value of the `Future` when completed, throws
  an `UninitializedCellError` when it is pending.

* `.isCompleted` property on cells holding a `Future`.

  Returns a cell which evaluates to `true` when the `Future` is complete, `false` while it is
  pending.

* `.initialValue(...)` which returns a cell with takes on the value of the given cell until it
  is initialized.


## 0.14.2

* Fix async examples in README.

## 0.14.1

Minor additions from core:

* `.waitLast` property which is the same as `.wait` but if a new Future is received before the
  previous one has completed, the previous future is dropped.

## 0.14.0

New features for asynchronous cells:

* `.wait` property for creating a cell that `await`s a `Future` held in another cell.
* `.delayed` for creating a cell that takes the value of another cell but only notifies its
  observers after a given delay.

Breaking changes:

* Removed `DelayCell`.

## 0.13.0

* `.cell` extension property is now available on all types

* Additions to `Iterable` cell extension:
  * `cast<E>()` method
  * `map()` method

* Additions to `List` cell extension:
  * `cast<E>()` method
  * `mapCells()` method

* Improvements to `CellWidget`:
  * Unused dependencies are untracked.
  * Widget properties can now be bound to different cells between builds.

## 0.12.1

* Increase live_cells_core dependency version to 0.12.3
* Increase live_cell_widgets dependency version to 0.2.2

## 0.12.0

New features in core:

New features:

* Record extension methods for creating lightweight computed (and mutable computed) cells:

  ```dart
  (a, b).apply((a,b) => a + b);
  (a, b).mutableApply((a,b) => a + b, (v) {...});
  ```

* `changesOnly` option in cell constructors. When this option is set to true, the cell only
  notifies its observers when its value has actually changed.

* Relaxed restriction that `MutableCellView` only accept a single argument

* Extensions which allow Iterable, List, Map and Set methods and properties to be used directly on
  cells:

New features in widgets library:

* Simplified state restoration:

  * No need to use `RestorableCellWidget`
  * Add `restorationId` directly on `CellWidget` / `StaticWidget`.
  * Added `.restore()` method for cell state restoration in `StaticWidget`
