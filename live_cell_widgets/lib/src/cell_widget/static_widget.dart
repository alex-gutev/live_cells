/// This allows stateful objects, such as [ValueCell]'s to be defined directly
/// in the build method:
///
/// ```dart
/// class Counter extends StaticWidget {
///   @override
///   Widget build(BuildContext context) {
///     final count = MutableCell(0);
///     final strCount = ValueCell.computed(() => count().toString());

///       child: CellText(data: strCount),
///       onPressed: () => count++
///     );
///   }
/// }
