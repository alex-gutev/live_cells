/// The function is called with no arguments and should return a [ValueCell].
typedef CreateCell<T extends ValueCell> = T Function();

/// Provides the [cell] method for creating and retrieving instances of [ValueCell]'s.
///
/// The [cell] method can be used within [build] to obtain an instance of
/// a [ValueCell] that is persisted between builds of the widget.
///
/// During the first build every call to [cell] will create a new [ValueCell]
/// instance using the provided cell creation function. In subsequent builds
/// calls to [cell] return the existing instance that was created during the
/// first build using the corresponding cell creation function.
///
/// Example:
///
/// ````dart
/// class Example extends CellWidget {
///   @override
///   Widget build(BuildContext context) {
///     final a = cell(() => MutableCell(0));
///     final b = cell(() => MutableCell(1));
///
///     final sum = cell(() => a + b);
///     final product = cell(() => a * b);
///
///     return Column(
///       children: [
///          Text('a + b = ${sum()}'),
///          Text('a * b = ${product()}')
///          ...
///       ]
///     );
///   }
/// }
/// ````
///
/// In the example above, when the widget is built for the first time, two
/// mutable cells are created and assigned to `a` and `b`, and two computed
/// cells `a + b`, `a * b` are assigned to `sum` and `product`, respectively.
/// In subsequent builds, the first two calls to [cell] return the same
/// [MutableCell] instances created during the first build and
/// `cell(() => a + b)` returns the existing instance of the cell `a + b`, while
/// `cell(() => a * b)` returns the existing instance of the cell `a * b`.
///
/// With this class cell definitions can be kept directly within the build function
/// without having to use a [StatefulWidget].
///
/// **NOTE**:
///
/// Uses of [cell] have to obey the following rules:
///
/// 1. Calls to [cell] must not appear within conditionals or loops.
/// 2. Calls to [cell] must not appear within widget builder functions, such as
///    those used with [Builder] or [ValueListenableBuilder].
